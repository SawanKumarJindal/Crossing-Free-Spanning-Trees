# Crossing-Free-Spanning-Trees
Spanning trees are one of the most important problems in theoretical science today. They can be seen as path finding algorithms which minimizes the cost of power networks, wiring connections, piping, automatic speech recognition, etc. In this project, we are analyzing geometric graphs and finding about the spanning trees with a special property of crossing-free nature, in them. We are using Markov Chain algorithms to sample random spanning trees.
In this project we are working with complete graphs and assuming that the points are in general position (that is, there are no three or more collinear points). We are analyzing crossing-free spanning trees in such graphs. Geometrical graphs are the graphs in which vertices are defined by set of points. In particular, we are aiming to generate a random crossing-free spanning tree, as well as to count all such spanning trees for a given graph.
